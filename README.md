# **Project: Coursework Mathematics**

This quote sums up the awe that Mathematics brings:
  > How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought independent of experience, is so admirably adapted to the objects of reality? - Albert Einstien
  
***Does anybody have a clue as to why Mathematics represents nature and reality with precision?***

## Motivation:
 
The treatment of Mathematics as a subject that's introduced in school causes us to undercelebrate it. Many people grow up to hate it, maybe because of the low grades they received, or the fact that they failed to understand the concept of 'Exponentials and Logarithms' in grade 10. The misconception of Mathematics being a part of Science doesn't help the cause either.
 
Mathematics, I believe, is the purest result of human mind and it's relation with abstraction. Two people, belonging to different cultural backgrounds, might meet and greet each other with "Hello" and "Namaste". But, both of them will understand (provided they have had the privilege of being educated) that if one of them has two pens in their pocket and the other person gives them two pens more, then the pocket will now consist of four pens.

Learning Mathematics is learning to speak the language of nature and it's working, understanding the hidden patterns and playing around with them to have an intimate relation with nature. 

This repository has been built to keep a track of coursework that I complete in Mathematics. The primary motivation is to keep learning and improving my mathematical skills, which in turn improves my intuition and ability to deal with abstraction.
